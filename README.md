# Stream-Networks
A set of real-world networks in the format of a network stream consisting of edge additions and deletions. The program to generate the networks from the original data is included. All sources are available in the source code. The networks were generated to test an algorithm for tracking subgraph occurrences in dynamic networks: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-65351-4_55
